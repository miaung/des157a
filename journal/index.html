                    I learned that the more comfort-to-reach, the more monetization. Placing ads at the bottom is common as well, and these techniques are considered dark-UX but it leads to more revenue for the company. I play many mobile games where I keep accidentally pressing an ad, so knowing that it’s intentional now is kind of betraying. As I continued reading, I also recognized how designers intentionally misplace the “X” so users don’t close content immediately. I particularly despise this design standard because it gets annoying looking for the “X.” However, it’s nice to know that decisions that are good for the user are intentionally placed on the right so it’s easier to reach, but I also noticed that designers do this when it comes to buying an in-game item so that’s annoying as well.

                <p>I took the photo on a car ride to see my family in Thailand. My family is from Burma, and due to a civil conflict within the country, it's not safe for Americans or any foreigners to visit. I captured the scenery as I knew it would be the closest I could be to my parent's country. This image relates to the topic of my archive because it's a collection of photos that I took of places that hold a special meaning to me. In this case it's traveling to a country in order to see my family after nearly 10 years of not seeing each other. My archive shows the car journey to the border of a country where I'm from but not allowed to visit due to political tensions.

                This image is about a dog, I believe a golden retriever, who is very sleepy. The most interesting aspect of this image is that the dog appears to be sleeping but in an upright position. I can tell that there is a background, so that means the dog is not fully laid down. I also see that it is bright because there is light shining on the dog's face, so either the dog is sleeping in a brightly-lit room or it is still daytime. The most obvious aspect of this image is that it's a dog. The most mysterious aspect is why the dog is so tired and where is it napping?

                <p>Decreasing attention spans is becoming more and more common as technology advances and social media becomes even more predatory on young viewers. Compared to before I used social media, I have definitely become less patient and more addicted to my phone. I notice this in my everyday life as I strive to be more efficient. Two tips in <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">“10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills”</a></p> that were given was to be detectives and practice regularly. I myself rarely pay attention to details unless it's for a project, but it's something that I want to be better at. I also have a bad habit of practicing daily routines so practicing close reading and visual thinking skills regularly would be a big change for me. <br> A website that I thought used image and interaction in an interesting way is <a href="https://guillaumecolombel.fr/">Guillaume Colombel's portfolio website</a>. An interactive animation that I thought was cool was when you scroll throughout the projects, the webpage pulls in the direction you scroll, almost like it's made of fabric. This really elevates my viewing experience, and brings a cool feature to the website.

            <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
            <div class="journal">
                <p>Date: <date datetime="2024-10-22">October 22nd 2024</date></p>
                <p>The article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">“Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows”</a> discusses features that can make your overlays user-friendly and follow typical design principles. One feature mentioned that I thought was important is the escape hatch, which allows users to close or cancel the overlay. This prevents the user from feeling trapped within the overlay. Sizing and location are very important as well. If the overlay is too big, it may be better justs to make a new page. You also want to make sure that the overlay isn't located off-center, and that the user can easily find it. Modals being user-initiated is important too. I often get annoyed when I enter a webpage for a store and they overwhelm me with multiple overlays for discount codes. Overlays should only be used when needed.</p>

            <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
            <div class="journal">

                <p>I agree with the comments made in the article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design"</a>, about conversion through forms since businesses typically want more orders or subscribers to their services. The user experience is important here, as when a viewer has a bad time completing a form, it can demotivate them, leading to the loss of potential business. A good practice mentioned in the article is visualizing the steps for the users in practice three. If a user feels that a form is too long and not worth the time to fill out, this can discourage them from continuing it. Adding visual cues of how far they are from the ending lets the user know when they'll be done with the form and if the time is worth filling out beforehand.</p>

                <p>An example of a website form that exemplifies best practices is the Beauty Quiz for <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/quiz/take/questions/skin-tone">IPSY</a>. It has a clear progress bar of how many steps the user has to go through to fill out the form, it starts with the easy questions first that are based on the user, and it minimizes drop-down menus by listing out the options for users.</p>
